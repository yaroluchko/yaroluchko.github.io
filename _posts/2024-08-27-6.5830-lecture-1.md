## What is a database
- collection of structured data
- organized as records + relationships between them

## The modern cloud data architecture
- AWS Aurora (OLTP DBMS)
- OLTP - online transaction processing, and typically the ones you use to build applications

Presentation Tier <-> Logic Tier <-> Client Tier

## Quiz 1
- Data modeling / layout
- Declarative querying
	- Query processing
	- Algorithms for accessing and manipulating data

---



## Why should we care?
Real world impact

## Concepts

### Data modeling & layout
- Systematic approach to structuring / representing data
- Constistency, sharing, efficiency of access to persistent data

### Declarative Querying and Query Processing
- Ask for data
- Compiler finds optimal plan
- Low-level techniques

### Consistency / Transactions + Concurrency Control
Basically, **ACID**:
- **Atomicity**: Operations are all-or-nothing
- **Consistency**: Semantics are well-defined, invariants are respected
- **Isolation**: Concurrent transactions are isolated from each other
- **Durability**: ðŸ¤ž Hope our data doesn't get lost

## Example - Zoo

A zoo website might have:
- admin interface that allows adding and editing animals
- public interface for viewing pictures and maps
- zookeeper interface for finding hungry animals

1k animals, 5k URLs, 10 admins, 200 keepers

## Zoo Data Model
Animal entity, Cage entity, Keeper entity

What info might we want to keep about an animal? Name, species, who is the keeper, which cage is it in, etc.?

Animals have names, ages, species
Keepers have names
Cages have feeding times, buildings
Animals are in 1 cage; cages have multiple animals
Keepers keep multiple cages, cages kept by multiple keepers

## Our Zoo
- Mike the Moose
- Tim the Giraffe
- Sally the student



### Operations
- move all snakes to new building
	- need to change many files

- multiple admins editing page at the same time
	- need concurrency control

- system may crash mid-update
	- need all-or-nothing operations

- need to find animal that was fed the longest ago
	- need efficient plan from database

Databases address all these issues and more
