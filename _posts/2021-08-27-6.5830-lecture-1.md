## What is a database
- collection of structured data
- organized as records + relationships between them

---

## Why should we care?
Real world impact

---

## Concepts

### Data modeling & layout
- Systematic approach to structuring / representing data
- Constistency, sharing, efficiency of access to persistent data

### Declarative Querying and Query Processing
- Ask for data
- Compiler finds optimal plan
- Low-level techniques

### Consistency / Transactions + Concurrency Control
Basically, **ACID**:
- **Atomicity**: Operations are all-or-nothing
- **Consistency**: Semantics are well-defined, invariants are respected
- **Isolation**: Concurrent transactions are isolated from each other
- **Durability**: ðŸ¤ž Hope our data doesn't get lost

## Example - Zoo

A zoo website might have:
- admin interface that allows adding and editing animals
- public interface for viewing pictures and maps
- zookeeper interface for finding hungry animals

### Operations
- move all snakes to new building
	- need to change many files

- multiple admins editing page at the same time
	- need concurrency control

- system may crash mid-update
	- need all-or-nothing operations

- need to find animal that was fed the longest ago
	- need efficient plan from database

Databases address all these issues and more
