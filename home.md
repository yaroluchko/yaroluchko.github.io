Hi, I'm Yaro Luchko, an MEng student at MIT. I'm starting this page as a way to keep track of my learning process and to be more intentional with taking lecture notes. In my free time I like to play video games (mostly Overwatch 2 and Osu!), work out, listen to music, and tinker with coding projects.
